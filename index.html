    <section id="intro">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This robot autonomously moves in a defined pattern, capturing plant photos every 1.5 hours. AI processes images to detect signs of disease or water deficiency and sends notifications to the user. Currently we can maintain 85% accuracy in plant health detection. We hope to improve this up to 97% accuracy with more data and user feedback.</p>
